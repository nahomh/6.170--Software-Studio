Meeting Minutes May 3, 2013
- We disucssed some ideas of hybrid approaches to incorporate multiple check-in quality checks to encourage correct use of MITspaces. We discussed how this issue may be a significant issue upon implementation, and how we will need to address it in future iterations. As of right now we will implement a working solution, and assume users will utlize the service correctly. User testing may also help in our search for a robust and efficient solution. 
- Geolocation problem was not identified, but we discussed some approaches by using timeouts to improve the browser's ability to gather locations
- In terms of implemention, we are in contact with the UA and discussed some approaches to also get in contact with MIT Facilities to coordinate an approach. 
- Timeline for the code: we will to have majority of the functionality for the code completed by Wednesday, with an additional couple of days to clean up the css and other small modifications.
